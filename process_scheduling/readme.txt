Implements CPU scheduling algorithms:
* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
* Priority (P)

of the inputted processes.
To run the program an input.txt file must be present in the same directory as the program executable file.
The input.txt must correctly be of the specified format.
An output.txt file will be created or overwritten which will contain the stated outputs.

The program has been tested on cpp verion 12.2.0
