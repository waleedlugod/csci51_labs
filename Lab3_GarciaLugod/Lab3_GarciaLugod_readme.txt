This program demonstrates and implementation of the linked list and stack data structures.

Running the program starts the linked list demonstration.
Upon receiving a prompt for the desired length of the linked list, enter only a positive integer.
Then enter the respective integers of each node after the corresponding prompt.
A list of numbers from the top of the linked list will be printed once finished.

The stack demonstration will start next.
Enter any valid action (push/pop/stop) after the provided prompt.
If push is entered, provide an integer as a value for the node to be pushed onto the stack.
If pop is entered, the top node will be deleted, and its value printed.
If stop is entered, the program will stop.
Popping an empty stack will print an empty stack error.

Inputting strings, floats, or any invalid inputs to the provided prompts will lead to undefined
behavior.
If pop() is called on IntStack when it is empty, it will always return -1.
